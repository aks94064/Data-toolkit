        "\n",
        "####\n",
        "### 2. How does broadcasting work in NumPy ?\n",
        "**Broadcasting in NumPy** is a mechanism that allows arrays of different shapes to be used together in arithmetic operations by automatically expanding the smaller array across the larger one without making extra copies. This makes computations more **efficient, memory-friendly, and concise**.\n",

        "####\n",
        "### 3. What is a Pandas DataFrame ?\n",
        "A **Pandas DataFrame** is a **two-dimensional, labeled data structure** in Python designed to represent **tabular data**. It organizes data into **rows (index)** and **columns (labels)**, where each column can hold different data types (heterogeneous). Built on top of **NumPy arrays**, it provides a flexible and intuitive way to handle structured data, making it similar to a **spreadsheet or SQL table**.\n",
